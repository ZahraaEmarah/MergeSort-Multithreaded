# MergeSort-Multithreaded

OS: Linux

Implementation of the usual Merge Sort algorithm but by using the multithreading approach.
It starts by reading a txt file containing the unsorted list and its size then the sorting process starts. 
Each time a split occurs two threads are generated one for each half of the list and so on.
